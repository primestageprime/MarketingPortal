      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>
        At PrimeStage, we provide software development, consulting services, and merchandise subject
        to these Terms & Conditions ("T&Cs"). The Statement of Work and/or Services Brief (referred
        to herein as "SOW") and performance of the parties thereunder is governed by and subject to
        these T&Cs which by reference are incorporated and made a part of the SOW, subject to any
        quote. PrimeStage means PrimeStage, Inc. "Customer" is identified as "Customer" or "You"
        herein, and collectively referred to with PrimeStage as "Parties" or separately as "Party".
        The T&Cs: • Are subject to change by PrimeStage from time to time • In effect as of the
        effective date of the SOW shall apply for the performance of that SOW • Will not apply
        retroactively to any SOW • Are dated and archived when superseded by a newer version
        PrimeStage represents that in the event You have a current signed agreement with PrimeStage
        regarding the subject-matter herein, then the terms and conditions of that agreement
        supersede any conflicting terms herein.

      <h3>1. SOW TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
      <p>
        PrimeStage will provide the services as specified in the SOW ("Services") governed by the
        T&Cs. In the event of a conflict between a term or condition in an SOW and those set forth
        here, these T&Cs will govern unless explicitly superseded in the SOW or as otherwise stated
        in the preamble herein.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>2. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>
      <p>
        The SOW begins on the date stated therein or, as otherwise mutually agreed between the
        Parties, and shall remain in effect for the term length stated in the SOW ("Services
        Period"). Either Party may notify the other in case of the other's alleged breach of a
        material provision of this SOW. The recipient shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of
        such notice to affect a cure. If the recipient of the notice fails to affect a cure within
        such period, then the sender of the notice shall have the option of sending a written notice
        of termination of the SOW, which notice shall take effect upon receipt. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, PrimeStage may suspend its services or terminate the SOW if Customer fails to pay
        an invoice when due and if such non-conformance is not cured within 10 days following
        receipt of notice from PrimeStage.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>3. PROJECT CHANGE REQUEST</h3>
      <p>
        Either Party may request a modification to any material provision of the SOW by submitting a
        Project Change Request ("PCR"). Upon receipt of a PCR, PrimeStage will estimate the
        financial and schedule impacts, if any. The Parties will review these estimates to determine
        whether the PCR would be mutually acceptable. If the Parties agree on the PCR, PrimeStage
        will attach the final PCR to the SOW. If the Parties are unable to agree within five (5)
        business days after the PCR is submitted, then the submitting Party may either withdraw the
        PCR or terminate the SOW with reasonable notice. If the SOW is terminated, due to an ability
        to reach agreement on a PCR, the only payments due are for the Work Product (defined herein
        below) delivered, Services performed, and expenses incurred by PrimeStage prior to the
        effective termination date.

      <h3>4. CUSTOMER MATERIALS DELAY</h3>
      <p>
        Customer acknowledges that PrimeStage's performance of the Services and delivery of the Work
        Product is contingent on Customer's timely delivery of any customer materials ("Customer
        Materials") provided to PrimeStage in connection with the Services. Customer agrees that any
        reasonable scheduling or financial impacts caused by Customer's failure to deliver Customer
        Materials within the specified time will be treated as a PCR.

      <h3>6. PAYMENT TERMS</h3>
      <p>
        PrimeStage shall submit invoices for fees and reimbursable costs and expenses as described
        in the SOW or quote plus all related taxes and withholdings, except for those based on
        PrimeStage's net income. All amounts are due in the currency stated on the invoice and in
        full 30 days after the date of PrimeStage's invoice or in the manner specified in the SOW,

        rate. If all or a portion of any invoice is determined to be incorrect, the Parties will
        promptly investigate and correct or confirm the dispute. PrimeStage is not obligated to
        perform its services unless Customer is current in payment of all fees and charges due.
        Except as otherwise set forth herein, payment obligations by Customer to PrimeStage shall
        survive expiration or termination of the SOW.
