export const wadeAboutMe =
	'I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2015 and initially embarked on a career in finance and wealth management. In 2019, I rekindled my true calling in software development. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to creating seamless, intuitive user interfaces that emphasize clarity and simplicity.  When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me exploring the Santa Barbara coast. Among many things, I am passionate about swimming, free diving, and cycling our scenic routes. I also find great joy in cooking, where I get to experiment and enjoy another form of creativity.  Some of my favorite dishes to make are inspired by the ocean, including (but definitely not limited to) lobster risotto, scallop aguachile, and halibut fish tacos.';
