export const wadeAboutMe = `I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2015 and initially embarked on a career in finance and wealth management. In 2019, I rekindled my true calling in software development. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to creating seamless, intuitive user interfaces that emphasize clarity and simplicity.  I have full-stack web development experience with several languages, frameworks, and databases.  My most recent ventures have included working in depth with React and SvelteKit.

When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me exploring the Santa Barbara coast. Among many things, I am passionate about swimming, free diving, and cycling our scenic routes. I also find great joy in cooking, where I get to experiment and enjoy another form of creativity.  Some of my favorite dishes to make are inspired by the ocean, including (but definitely not limited to) lobster risotto, scallop aguachile, and halibut fish tacos.`;

export const peterAboutMe = `With a passion for technology that started at age eight, I have a deep background in software development, data analytics, and database management. My early work in Telephony (CallWave) and Cloud Computing (RightScale) challenged me to handle big data at scale, dealing with hundreds of millions of records. I then dedicated nearly a decade to building and managing teams that create  platforms, enabling businesses to gain actionable insights from their data.
    
Today, I’m focused on creating user-centered, greenfield solutions, bringing together a team I trust to innovate with the end user as the primary focus. Beyond technology, I enjoy reading, playing beach volleyball, experimenting with stir fry recipes, and training my Labrador, Thor, in agility.`;
